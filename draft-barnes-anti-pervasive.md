--- abstract

Since the summer of 2013, leaked documents have revealed several large-scale efforts by intelligence agencies to exploit security weaknesses in the Internet.  In this document, we review the technical means used by these agencies to break into Internet applications, and develop a classification of attacks and capabilities.  Based on this classification, we lay out a set of design principles that can help counter these attacks.

## Terminology
