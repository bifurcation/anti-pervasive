anti-pervasive
==============

A problem statement draft on countering pervasive monitoring.

This draft is being written in Kramdown.  To create the official IETF forms, you will need [kramdown-rfc2629][] and [xml2rfc][], and generating PDF requires [cupsfilter][] (available by default on Mac OS).  Or you can just use [draftr]. 

The included Makefile should enable you to just type `make` to generate the XML, TXT, and HTML forms (use `make pdf` to get a PDF).  I will try to keep fresh copies here in the repo, but no guarantees.
